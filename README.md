# T-Spark Dump

A DUMP of some of my work from the 2020 Tencent T-Spark Future Academy.

My presentation at the 2022 Tencent T-Spark Challenge Programme (AI+ track: Human Hand Liveness Detection).

A heavily redacted version of my presentation at the 2021 Tencent T-Spark Challenge Programme (Short Video Recommendation Algorithms track), due to commercial confidentiality.

Please Note:
* Most of the content is in Chinese, as the programmes were conducted in Chinese.
* This is just a DUMP of some highlights and materials. It is not carefully compiled nor contains everything (or even every important thing).
