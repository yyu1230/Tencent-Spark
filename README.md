# T-Spark Dump

Some highlights from my works at the 2020 Tencent T-Spark Future Academy National Extended Hackathon and the 2022 Tencent T-Spark Challenge Programme (AI+ track: Human Hand Liveness Detection). \
A heavily redacted version of my presentation in the 2021 Tencent T-Spark Challenge Programme (Short Video Recommendation Algorithms track) is also available, upon removing commercially confidential material.

Please Note:
* Most of the content is in Chinese, as the programmes were conducted in Chinese.
* This is just a DUMP of some highlights and materials. It is not carefully compiled nor contains everything (or even everything important).
